# 2DO
To Do List App made with CRUD functionality using Java, XML, SQLite and TDD in Android Studio.

### Overview
2DO was a week long Java project undertaken to practice, and consolidate learning of the following topics:

- Java fundamentals
- Android Studio
- Data persistence 
- TDD
- OOP
- Databases (SQL) with CRUD actions

### MVP
Create an app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task. Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.
As a minimum, users should be able to:

* Create new tasks
* Display a list of all tasks
* Add a category to a task
* Display tasks by category
* Have CRUD actions for the tasks

### Installation
To install and run a copy of 2DO: 
1. ```git clone``` this repository down to your own machine and ```cd``` into the repo folder, in your terminal.
2. Open the project folder with Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html
3. Click ```run``` and choose the emulator you wish to run in (you may have to create one)
4. The app should load after a couple of seconds
